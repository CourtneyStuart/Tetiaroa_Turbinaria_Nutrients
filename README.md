Courtney's PhD research is part of the [Seabird-Island-Reef](https://www.marine.science/project/implications-of-nutrient-flow-and-feedback-across-the-seabird-island-reef-system/) project funded by the [Bertarelli Foundation](https://www.fondation-bertarelli.org/) and led by P.I. Nick Graham of Lancaster University, and supports the ongoing [Tetiaroa Atoll Restoration Project](https://www.tetiaroasociety.org/programs/conservation/tetiaroa-habitat-restoration-program). 

# Abstract
Pelagic-feeding seabirds deliver nutrient subsidies that support the growth, resilience, and biodiversity of both terrestrial and marine ecosystems, particularly in oligotrophic tropical environments. This study investigates the biogeophysical drivers of seabird-vectored nutrient delivery in a small, semi-enclosed coral atoll to identify spatial patterns that can inform restoration efforts. Focusing on Tetiaroa, French Polynesia, where recent rat eradication aims to restore seabird populations, we analysed nitrogen isotope (δ¹⁵N) signatures in the marine alga Turbinaria ornata as a proxy for seabird nutrient inputs. Our generalised additive models (GAMs) revealed significant relationships between seabird-derived nutrients and biogeophysical predictors. Depth and distance to land were consistently associated with δ¹⁵N patterns, with nutrient enrichment peaking in shallow, nearshore areas. Profile and planform curvatures also emerged as important factors, suggesting that localised seafloor geomorphology influences water flow and nutrient retention. The strongest signals of nutrient enrichment were detected around the northern and southeastern islands, which are known to harbour high densities of breeding and roosting seabirds. While incorporating high-resolution geomorphological predictors improved model refinement, a simpler model focusing on depth, offshore distance, and geographic positioning relative to the broader atoll performed similarly in predicting nutrient distribution. By identifying current nutrient spatial patterns and their drivers, this research provides critical insights to support atoll-wide restoration plans aimed at bolstering the biodiversity and resilience of terrestrial and marine ecosystems in this recovering atoll.
