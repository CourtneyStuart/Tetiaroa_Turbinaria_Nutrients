This repository holds code, data, and other files related to the first data chapter of Courtney Stuart’s PhD research at the University of Oxford [Seascape Ecology Lab](https://www.oxfordseascapeecologylab.com/) (P.I. Dr Lisa Wedding). Courtney's PhD research is part of the [Seabird-Island-Reef](https://www.marine.science/project/implications-of-nutrient-flow-and-feedback-across-the-seabird-island-reef-system/) project funded by the [Bertarelli Foundation](https://www.fondation-bertarelli.org/) and led by P.I. Nick Graham of Lancaster University, and supports the ongoing [Tetiaroa Atoll Restoration Project](https://www.tetiaroasociety.org/programs/conservation/tetiaroa-habitat-restoration-program). 

# Abstract
Pelagic-feeding seabirds deliver nutrient subsidies that enhance the growth, resilience, and biodiversity of both terrestrial and marine ecosystems, particularly in nutrient-poor tropical environments. However, the fine-scale biogeophysical drivers that govern the fluxes of these nutrients across coupled island-reef systems remain poorly understood. To address this, we examined the spatial distribution of seabird-vectored nutrients in the seascape of Tetiaroa, a small, semi-enclosed coral atoll in French Polynesia, where seabird populations and resultant nutrient cycles are recovering after recent rat eradication. Our findings show that depth, distance to land, geographic location within the atoll, and seafloor curvature consistently influence nutrient enrichment patterns, contributing valuable insights to support ongoing restoration efforts. Using the nitrogen isotope (δ¹⁵N) signatures of marine algae as evidence of seabird-vectored nutrient uptake, our models reveal peak enrichment in shallow, nearshore areas where water flow slows and converges due to localised curvature, particularly around islands with high breeding seabird biomass. These results extend previous research by highlighting seafloor geomorphology, particularly curvature, as a key modulator of fine-scale nutrient delivery patterns. This modulation influences the availability of beneficial seabird-vectored nutrients for habitat-engineering corals, with potential implications for higher trophic levels. While adding complex biogeophysical variables further refined predicted spatial patterns, a simpler model using depth, offshore distance, and geographic location proved similarly effective. This study identifies the configuration and complexity characteristics likely to affect recovery potential following the restoration of seabird-vectored nutrient cycles, providing valuable guidance for targeted restoration efforts on land and at sea, such as replanting native vegetation and clearing competitive macroalgae. Furthermore, this research sets the stage for future investigations into whether the effects of biogeophysical drivers on nutrient delivery are consistent in magnitude and direction across island-reef systems in different geographic, geological, and anthropogenic contexts.
